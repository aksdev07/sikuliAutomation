# sikuliAutomation
There are several applications which are not based on html, angular js rather they are flash application now a days it is called as flash X
YouTube.com is one example of that
YouTube will not have Xpaths to locate it elements like play/pause
rather it cannot be automated using selenium.

Here Siluli comes into the picture. Using sikuli framework one can automate flash based apps.

In place of xpaths it just need the screenshot of that icon and then things will be done for real.
